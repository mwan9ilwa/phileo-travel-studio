Okay, let's break down how to build a SaaS travel and tours website with Next.js and a CMS. Here's a comprehensive guide covering key aspects, technologies, and considerations:

1. Project Setup and Technology Stack

Next.js: (Framework) For building React-based applications with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. It offers excellent performance, SEO, and developer experience.

React: (JavaScript Library) The foundation for building your user interface.

CMS (Content Management System): This is crucial for your use case. I highly recommend the following, taking into consideration the need to add/edit content and manage bookings.

Strapi: A flexible, open-source headless CMS. Excellent for defining your data structures (tour types, destinations, accommodations, etc.). You'll consume the data from Strapi in your Next.js app via API calls. Offers Role-Based Access Control. Excellent for customizability.

Sanity: Another headless CMS. Provides a rich editing experience with structured content and real-time collaboration. Great for complex content models.

Database: (if you choose Strapi): Strapi supports several databases. PostgreSQL is a robust and scalable option for production. SQLite is fine for initial development.

Styling:

Tailwind CSS: (Recommended) A utility-first CSS framework. Fast, highly customizable, and promotes a consistent design language.

Styled Components: (Alternative) Write CSS-in-JS.

State Management:

Context API + useReducer (for simple state): Built-in to React, good for smaller apps or local state.

Zustand (for more complex global state): Is small, fast and uses simplified boilerplate.

Redux Toolkit (for very complex state): Is mature and well documented.

Authentication:

NextAuth.js: A complete open-source authentication solution built specifically for Next.js. Supports various providers (Google, Facebook, email/password, etc.). Essential for user accounts and potentially admin access.

API Routes (Next.js): Create serverless functions for handling form submissions, interacting with external APIs (payment gateways, map services), and more.

Deployment:

Vercel: (Recommended) Seamless integration with Next.js, automatic deployments, global CDN.
